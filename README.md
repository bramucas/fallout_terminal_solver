# Fallout Terminal solver

This simple tool is intended to help the user find the terminal solution in the Fallout video game series. This is not a mod for the game, it is an external software written in python.

Actual code it is an old code that wrote a couple of years ago when I was learning python and OO programming. So it needs a refactor.

### Dependencies

PYGObject installed.

### Running

```bash
python run.py
```

### Ideas and future work

 * Text recognition from screenshots of the game with Python OpenCv OCR
